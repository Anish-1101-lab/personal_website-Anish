\# 🧑‍💻 Anish Sathyanarayanan – Portfolio

Welcome to the codebase for my \*\*personal portfolio\*\*, crafted as a \*\*terminal-based interactive website\*\*. This project reflects my passion for clean interfaces, the command line, and delivering a distinctive developer experience.

\---

\## 💻 Terminal Interface

My portfolio is not a typical webpage — it’s a \*\*fully interactive terminal UI\*\*! It mimics the command-line environment, offering a unique way to navigate and explore who I am.

This design choice mirrors my enthusiasm for minimal, keyboard-driven interfaces and sets my portfolio apart.

\## 🚀 How to Interact

Upon visiting the website, you'll be welcomed with a terminal prompt.

To get started, type:

\`\`\`bash

help

This command will list all available options and ways to interact with the portfolio. Feel free to explore, run commands, and get to know me through the terminal.
